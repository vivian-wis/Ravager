## Installation
- Ravager can be deployed and used in the following ways

## Heroku
- Click [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/vivian-wis/Ravager) and fill the environment variables accordingly.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Docker

- ### Docker Compose
    1) Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/CoolFool/Ravager/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) for running on a server or [docker-compose-local.yml](https://github.com/CoolFool/Ravager/blob/main/docker-compose-local.yml) for running locally with ngrok or other tunneling service for oauth authentication
    2) Open the file in a text editor and fill the environment variables
    3) - If `docker-compose-local.yml` is used you have to create a docker network called `ravager_net`
       - Forward the connection for `ravager_net` with port `8443` using ngrok or some other tunneling service.
       - Get the ip for `ravager_net` using the command `docker inspect ravager_net`
       - For ngrok the command should be as follows: `./ngrok http <ravager_net_ip>:8443`
       - The url from ngrok will be used as telegram bot webhook and oauth endpoint
       - Add the ngrok url and the oauth endpoint `ngrok_url/oauth_handler` to google's oauth api authorized domain.
    4) Execute the following command in the same directory
        ```
        docker-compose up -d
        ```
    5) The bot should be up and running
    6) For checking the logs you can use `docker logs -f ravager`
